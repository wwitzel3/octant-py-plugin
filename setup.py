    # When your source code is in a subdirectory under the project root, e.g.
    # `src/`, it is necessary to specify the `package_dir` argument.
    package_dir={'': 'src'},  # Optional

    # You can just specify package directories manually here if your project is
    # simple. Or you can use find_packages().
    #
    # Alternatively, if you just want to distribute a single Python file, use
    # the `py_modules` argument instead as follows, which will expect a file
    # called `my_module.py` to exist:
    #
    #   py_modules=["my_module"],
    #
    packages=find_packages(where='src'),  # Required

    # Specify which Python versions you support. In contrast to the
    # 'Programming Language' classifiers above, 'pip install' will check this
    # and refuse to install the project if the version does not match. If you
    # do not support Python 2, you can simplify this to '>=3.5' or similar, see
    # https://packaging.python.org/guides/distributing-packages-using-setuptools/#python-requires
    python_requires='>=3.5, <4',

    # This field lists other packages that your project depends on to run.
    # Any package you put here will be installed by pip when your project is
    # installed, so they must be valid existing projects.
    #
    # For an analysis of "install_requires" vs pip's requirements files see:

    install_requires=['grpcio', 'grpcio-health-checking'],  # Optional


    # To provide executable scripts, use entry points in preference to the
    # "scripts" keyword. Entry points provide cross-platform support and allow
    # `pip` to create the appropriate form of executable for the target
    # platform.
    #
    # For example, the following would provide a command called `sample` which
    # executes the function `main` from this package when invoked:
